                    <p>I am a passionate and driven web developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                        As
                        a coding beginner, I am constantly exploring new technologies and enhancing my skills through
                        hands-on projects and continuous learning. My journey in web development is fueled by a love for
                        creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites. I enjoy problem-solving and bringing
                        creative ideas to life through code.

                        Currently, I am focused on building a solid understanding of front-end development while
                        expanding
                        my knowledge of frameworks and libraries like React. My goal is to grow into a versatile
                        full-stack
                        developer who can build dynamic and scalable web applications. I am excited to collaborate on
                        innovative projects and contribute to meaningful solutions that impact users positively.
